# WeatherApp

The WeatherApp is a React-based weather application that provides users with current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data for a specified location. This project is designed for individuals who want a simple and intuitive way to access weather information for different locations around the world. Whether you're planning a trip, checking the weather for your current location, or just curious about the forecast, WeatherApp offers a user-friendly interface for obtaining accurate and up-to-date weather details. With its responsive design and interactive features, it caters to users who seek a visually appealing and efficient weather tracking experience.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.



### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.




### Usage
Simply run the application, and the current weather information and 5-day forecast for a default location (India) will be displayed. You can customize the location by interacting with the search functionality.


### Components
